abstract = {Despite its widespread adoption, the success of radiofrequency (RF) ablation is often limited by challenges in achieving durable, transmural lesions while avoiding complications such as incomplete ablation or over-ablation. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers high-resolution visualization of cardiac tissue, enabling real-time assessment of lesion depth. Therefore, we investigated the impact of RF ablation on donated human left atrial tissue using an OCT imaging system to assess lesion formation in a controlled laboratory setting. RF ablation lesions were created at durations of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 seconds (s), and their effects were quantified by calculating the attenuation coefficient from OCT images. To identify tissue regions in the image, a U-Net model was employed for segmentation, achieving a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 0.9748 with an inference time of 82 milliseconds. Our results demonstrated clear differences in tissue response before and after ablation, with distinct lesion characteristics across the tested durations. One-way ANOVA analysis yielded a p-value of 1.09\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;10\&\#x2212;8, confirming statistically significant differences among the ablation durations. These findings highlight the potential of SD-OCT for precise, real-time monitoring of ablation effects. Future work aims to integrate OCT with ablation catheters for clinical applications, enhancing the precision of catheter-based treatments for conditions like atrial fibrillation.},

abstract = {Abstract Aging impairs cerebrovascular structure and function, contributing to cognitive decline and dementia. Here, a novel, high-resolution, intravital imaging platform is presented that combines functional ultrasound (fUS) and ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) through a chronically implanted, polymethylpentene (TPX) cranial window, a transparent implant that enables ultrasound imaging through the skull. This approach enables intravital, longitudinal, minimally invasive assessment of cerebrovascular structure and function across cortical and deep brain regions. Leveraging this platform, a new method is developed to estimate resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) by integrating microbubble (MB) velocity data from fUS with microvascular geometry derived from ULM. Notably, a significant age-related decline in the cortical arteriole-to-venule ratio (AVR) is discovered, introducing a novel biomarker of structural cerebrovascular remodeling. It is also validated that fUS can reliably assess neurovascular coupling (NVC) responses in aged mice. This study establishes a powerful, non-invasive, and repeatable investigative tool for future preclinical studies aimed at evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions targeting vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {Objective
This study aimed to compare microvascular Doppler sonography (MDS) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) for assessing vessel patency and aneurysm occlusion during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms.
Methods
MDS and LSCI were used after clip placement during six neurovascular procedures including six patients, and agreement between the two techniques was assessed. LSCI was performed in parallel or right after MDS evaluation. The Doppler response was assessed through listening while flow in the LSCI videos was evaluated by three blinded neurovascular surgeons after the surgery. Statistical analysis determined the agreement between the techniques in assessing flow in 18 regions of interest (ROIs).
Results
Agreement between MDS and LSCI in assessing vessel patency was observed in 87 % of the ROIs. LSCI accurately identified flow in 93.3 % of assessable ROIs, with no false positive or negative measurements. Three ROIs were not assessable with LSCI due to motion artifacts or poor image quality. No complications were observed.
Conclusions
LSCI demonstrated high agreement with MDS in assessing vessel patency during microsurgical clipping of intracranial aneurysms. It provided continuous, real-time, full-field imaging with high spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While MDS allowed evaluation of deep vascular regions, LSCI complemented it by offering unlimited assessment of surrounding vessels.},

ABSTRACT={AVM surgery is challenging due to progressive and often unforeseeable flow changes during its resection which involve both the AVM and the surrounding brain tissue. Hence, accurate monitoring of blood flow is crucial to minimize complications and improve outcomes. The following case report illustrates the usefulness of complimentary non-invasive tools that can provide real time blood flow assessment. We present a case demonstrating the application of laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) in evaluating vessel flow dynamics during AVM surgery. A 30-year-old female presented with sudden headaches, nausea, vomiting, and vertigo. Emergency imaging revealed a ruptured cerebellar AVM necessitating surgical intervention. LSCI was integrated into the surgical workflow, providing continuous visualization of relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) of vessels surrounding the AVM. Before AVM resection, LSCI measurements revealed the arterialized vasculature supplying the AVM nidus; measurements after AVM resection showed significant hemodynamic changes including normal flow in the initially arterialized AVM draining veins and adjacent arterial branches. LSCI also detected blood flow alterations during temporary occlusion, enabling assessment of downstream vascular regions. In conclusion, we provide an example supporting the utility of LSCI for real-time hemodynamic monitoring during AVM resection surgery. LSCI offers non-invasive, continuous, and immediate blood flow information, complementing conventional imaging methods like indocyanine green angiography. Additionally, our findings suggest that LSCI has the potential to provide a non-invasive means of identifying the specific superficial vessel branches or cortical areas that receive blood supply from a particular vessel.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
